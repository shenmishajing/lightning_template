## Manual installation

First of all, you have to choose the version of some packages and install them from their official site manually, mainly some packages related to cuda, and also, you have to choose the cuda version.

### Python

We recommend you use the latest version of Python, which works well generally and may provide a better performance. The minimum supported version of Python is `3.8`.
